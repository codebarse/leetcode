OptimalSoln1 : {
	Time Complexity : O(n)
	Space Complexity : O(n)
	Solution : {
		1. Use a Map to maintain the numbers that exist in the input as key alongwith their index as value.
		2. For each number 'x' in input vector, check if (target - x) exists. If it does exist then we have found the two numbers.
	}
