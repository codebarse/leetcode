OptimalSoln1 : {
	Time Complexity : O(n)
	Space Complexity : O(n)
	Solution : {
		1. Since the numbers are already reversed in the input, we can traverse the linked list normally to add.
		2. At every step we add the values in the current nodes of both the linked lists alongwith any carry of a previous step(Init carry=0). Say 's' is the sum, we put s%10 in a new node and remember this reference. 
		3. We keep adding new nodes at the end of the previous reference with the sum at each step.
		4. Carry will be s/10.
		5. We keep adding till both linked lists reach null. When only one of them reaches null, use 0 as the value for it.
		6. Check if there is a non-zero carry left after the loop. Add a new node to the end of result for it.
		7. The answer will be in reversed order as well.
