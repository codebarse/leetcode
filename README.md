# Purpose #
1.	This is supposed to be a repository for as many Leetcode solutions as possible.
2.	Another aim is to have highly intuitive or atleast well explained solutions for all problems solved. We often fail to understand solutions provided by [LeetCode](http://www.leetcode.com/) and this will serve us better since solutions will be written by all of us. Lets hope that it becomes a high quality reference in the future.
3.	It may prove to be a motivation for some to solve problems just because it feels better to push it to github and have your friends see it. Basically you get bragging rights.

# Guildelines
1.	Create a folder with the format ***"Problem#X"*** where X is some positive integer. This unique identifier should be taken from [leetcode.com](http://www.leetcode.com/) itself for easy referencing later.
2.	Inside the folder created above will be a sub directory called ***"Code"*** . Everyone has to put their code with the correct naming format inside it. The format for now is ***"yournameinsmallletters"*** . e.g Lalit will use *lalit.cpp*, Avantika will use *avantika.java* etc.
3.	The first one to solve a problem always has to submit a ***Readme*** alongwith it. Anyone who solves it in the future will be allowed to make changes to the file. Remember we are not creating just a code dumping repo.
4.	Go through the [SampleReadme](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codebarse/leetcode/master/SampleReadme) to understand what format to follow. If that looks too much, just read [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codebarse/leetcode/master/Problem%231/Readme). It is okay if you use ***Hindi*** to explain as well.
5.	Your first few drafts of the Readme are allowed to be shitty. Don't procrastinate pushing your Readme just to make it perfect from the get go. Use this [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codebarse/leetcode/master/DefaultReadme) to save yourself some time.
